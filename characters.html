  <h1>Hello There, Obi-Wan Kenobi is my name. 57 BBY - 1 BBY</h1>
    <b>"You can kill me, but you will never destroy me. It takes strength to resist the dark side. Only the weak embrace it."
        "It is more powerful than you know."
        "And those who oppose it are more powerful than you'll ever be."
        ―Obi-Wan Kenobi and Maul.
        Obi-Wan Kenobi was a legendary Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Republic Era. As a High Jedi General, Kenobi served in the Grand Army of the Republic that fought against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars, and was nicknamed "the Negotiator." Kenobi, however, was forced into exile as a result of the Great Jedi Purge initiated by the Republic's own clone troopers when Republic Supreme Chancellor, secretly Darth Sidious, implemented Order 66. As a mentor, Kenobi was responsible for training two members of the Skywalker family, Anakin and Luke Skywalker, both of whom served in turn as his Padawan in the ways of the Force.</b>
